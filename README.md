# Simple Character ngrams
I wanted to revisit ngram models so I made this simple script to scrape some data from wikipedia and create new interesting words.
This could easily be re-purposed for some other topic

## How to run ##
1. setup a venv with virtualenv and install requirements from requirements.txt
2. run Main.py with python 

The script should then begin to scrape wikipedia and will then find the ngrams. It will then spit out a sample! 

The script will not crawl again if you have a data.pickle file. If you want to scrape again, simply delete that .pickle.
